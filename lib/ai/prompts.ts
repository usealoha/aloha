Produce a RICH draft for ONE target platform: the finished post body PLUS the structured scaffolding around it (hook, CTA, alt hooks, key points, hashtags, a media suggestion, rationale). Output goes into a composer sidebar, so the user can see why this shape — and swap the hook / CTA with one click.

Rules:
- The "body" is the publishable post text, native to the platform (length, structure, emoji rate, line breaks). This is what lands in the editor. Do not wrap in quotes. Do not prefix with labels.
- The "hook" is the opening line of the body, extracted verbatim. It must match the first line of "body".
- "altHooks": 2–3 alternative opening lines the user might prefer. Each a complete, punchy line in voice. Same length norms as the hook.
- "keyPoints": 3–5 bullets describing the beats the post hits. For a thread/carousel these are the tweets/slides. For a single post these are the supporting claims. Written as finished sentences.
- "cta": the closing call-to-action line. Empty string if the post genuinely doesn't need one on this platform.
- "hashtags": array of hashtags appropriate for the platform (see constraints). Each INCLUDES '#'. Empty array is fine.
- "mediaSuggestion": 1 sentence describing the ideal accompanying media. Empty string if text-only is right.
- "rationale": 1 sentence, ≤160 chars, why this draft works on this platform for this topic.
- "formatGuidance": 1 sentence, ≤140 chars, the shape the post takes ("single punchy post", "5-tweet thread with a payoff", "6-slide carousel", "15s hook-led vertical video script").

Given the user's goal, themes, target channels, posting frequency per week, date range, voice profile, and (optionally) best publishing windows per channel + recent inspiration items, produce a schedule of post ideas that are rich enough to become real drafts.

Rules:
- Respect the weekly frequency. Spread posts across the full date range, not clumped.
- Use best-time windows when provided — propose a specific day that falls inside one of them.
- Assign each idea to EXACTLY ONE channel from the user's allowed list. Rotate across channels rather than stacking the same one.
- Pick a format native to the channel (threads on X, document carousels on LinkedIn, short-video on TikTok, etc.).
- Bias toward variety: themes, angles, and formats should not repeat across the week.
- If "recent inspiration" items are provided, use them as seed material — don't restate them, but make 1–2 ideas riff on those angles.
- Every idea must be detailed enough that a user could open it and see the shape of the actual post, not a one-line topic.

Per-idea field rules:
- "title": ≤60 chars, working title only. Not the hook.
- "angle": ≤200 chars, 1 sentence, what the post will argue / show / teach.
- "hook": the actual opening line of the post, written in voice. ≤160 chars for short platforms (X, Threads, Bluesky), ≤240 elsewhere.
- "keyPoints": 3–5 bullets, each a concrete beat the post will hit. For a thread/carousel these are the slides/tweets. For a single post these are the supporting claims. Each ≤140 chars. Written as finished sentences, not instructions.
- "cta": the closing line / call-to-action, written in voice. ≤120 chars. Empty string if the post genuinely doesn't need one.
- "hashtags": 0–N hashtags matching platform norms (X: 0–2, LinkedIn: 3–5, Instagram: 8–15, TikTok: 3–5, Threads: 0–2, others: 0–3). Each INCLUDES the leading '#'. Empty array when the platform doesn't use them (Reddit, Bluesky) or when nothing clearly relevant fits.
- "mediaSuggestion": one sentence describing the ideal media (e.g. "screenshot of the dashboard with the metric circled", "selfie-style talking-head, 15s, vertical"). Empty string if text-only is correct for the channel.
- "rationale": 1 sentence, ≤160 chars, why this post on this channel on this day — ties back to goal, theme, best-window, or inspiration.

Unlike a weekly content plan, a campaign has **narrative phases** the beats should move through. Pick from these phases based on the campaign kind:

- launch: teaser → announce → social_proof → urgency → recap
- webinar: teaser → announce → reminder → recap → follow_up
- sale: teaser → announce → social_proof → urgency → last_call → recap
- drip: evergreen cadence — roughly teaser → announce → social_proof, rotating across a longer range
- evergreen: steady rhythm of announce + social_proof + teaser variants, no urgency
- custom: mix phases as appropriate for the goal

Rules:
- Respect the date range. Spread beats so the arc feels deliberate, not stacked.
- Each beat targets ONE channel from the user's allowed list. Rotate across channels.
- \`phase\` tracks where the beat sits in the arc. Use only: teaser, announce, social_proof, urgency, last_call, recap, reminder, follow_up.
- \`format\` is one of: single, thread, carousel, long-form, short-video, link.
- \`title\` is a working headline the user will polish (60 chars max).
- \`angle\` is the one-sentence hook: what this beat is saying / showing / asking.
- Typical beat counts: launch 7–12, webinar 5–8, sale 8–14, drip 10–20, evergreen 6–10.
