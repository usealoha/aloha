- Start with the primary subject.
- If the image contains readable text, include it verbatim in quotes.

Given the user's goal, themes, target channels, posting frequency per week, date range, voice profile, and (optionally) best publishing windows per channel + recent inspiration items, produce a schedule of post ideas.

Rules:
- Respect the weekly frequency. Spread posts across the full date range, not clumped.
- Use best-time windows when provided — propose a specific day that falls inside one of them.
- Assign each idea to EXACTLY ONE channel from the user's allowed list. Rotate across channels rather than stacking the same one.
- "title" is a 60-char max working title the user will refine later.
- "angle" explains what the post will argue/show/teach in 1 sentence (<200 chars).
- "format" is one of: single, thread, carousel, long-form, short-video, link.
  Pick a format native to the channel (threads on X, document carousels on LinkedIn, short-video on TikTok, etc.).
- Bias toward variety: themes, angles, and formats should not repeat across the week.
- If "recent inspiration" items are provided, use them as seed material — don't restate them, but make 1–2 ideas riff on those angles.

Output STRICT JSON (no fences, no prose):

- 85–100: exceptional hook + payoff, tight, native to the platform.
- 70–84: solid, publishable, with minor improvements available.
- 50–69: workable but with one or two real issues (weak hook, buried lead, filler, missing CTA, wrong length).
- 30–49: several real issues; rewrite recommended.
- below 30: fundamental problems (empty, off-topic, spammy, violates platform norms).
