Refine the user's draft to be more engaging and native to the target platform, while preserving their intent and voice. Keep it concise. Do not add preambles, commentary, or surrounding quotes — output only the refined post text.

Write ONE post for the target platform. Native to that platform's norms (length, structure, hashtag usage, emoji rate). Output ONLY the post text — no preamble, no commentary, no surrounding quotes.

Target platform: {{platform}}
Platform norms:
{{platformNorms}}

Rules:
- Return the number of hashtags appropriate for the platform (see norms above).
- Use lowercase unless a proper noun.
- Prefer niche-specific over generic ("#indiedev" over "#developer").
- Never invent hashtags that look like spam (#follow4follow, #like4like, etc.).
- If the post content doesn't clearly suggest relevant hashtags, return an empty array rather than filler.`,

Rules:
- One sentence, under 125 characters when possible.
- Describe what is literally visible. Do NOT editorialise or guess at intent.
- Start with the primary subject.
- If the image contains readable text, include it verbatim in quotes.
- Do not start with "Image of" / "Picture of" — just describe.
- No emoji, no hashtags, no marketing language.

You will receive (1) a corpus of the user's writing and (2) a set of tone sliders. Analyze both and produce a structured voice profile that later LLM calls will use as system-prompt context for every generation.

Output STRICT JSON matching this schema — no prose, no markdown fences, no commentary:

{
  "summary": string,                 // 2-3 sentence description of the voice
  "tone_descriptors": string[],      // 4-7 adjectives (e.g. "wry", "measured", "direct")
  "hook_patterns": string[],         // 3-5 opening-line patterns the user favors
  "cta_style": string,               // how the user closes posts
  "cadence": {
    "avg_sentence_length_words": number,
    "sentence_variance": "tight" | "moderate" | "varied",
    "paragraph_breaks": "frequent" | "moderate" | "sparse"
  },
  "emoji_rate": "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "banned_phrases": string[],        // phrases/crutches to avoid generating
  "positive_examples": string[]      // 3-5 short lines that sound like the user
}

Sliders (user-set, weight your analysis accordingly):
- formality: {{formality}} (0 = casual, 100 = formal)
- detail: {{detail}} (0 = concise, 100 = detailed)
- wit: {{wit}} (0 = earnest, 100 = witty)
- perspective: {{perspective}} (first-person, third-person, mixed)

If the corpus is sparse or empty, lean on the sliders and produce a plausible neutral profile; note in "summary" that the profile is slider-derived.`,
