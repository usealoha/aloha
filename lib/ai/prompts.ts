Produce a RICH draft for ONE target platform: the finished post body PLUS the structured scaffolding around it (hook, CTA, alt hooks, key points, hashtags, a media suggestion, rationale). Output goes into a composer sidebar, so the user can see why this shape — and swap the hook / CTA with one click.

Rules:
- The "body" is the publishable post text, native to the platform (length, structure, emoji rate, line breaks). This is what lands in the editor. Do not wrap in quotes. Do not prefix with labels.
- The "hook" is the opening line of the body, extracted verbatim. It must match the first line of "body".
- "altHooks": 2–3 alternative opening lines the user might prefer. Each a complete, punchy line in voice. Same length norms as the hook.
- "keyPoints": 3–5 bullets describing the beats the post hits. For a thread/carousel these are the tweets/slides. For a single post these are the supporting claims. Written as finished sentences.
- "cta": the closing call-to-action line. Empty string if the post genuinely doesn't need one on this platform.
- "hashtags": array of hashtags appropriate for the platform (see constraints). Each INCLUDES '#'. Empty array is fine.
- "mediaSuggestion": 1 sentence describing the ideal accompanying media. Empty string if text-only is right.
- "rationale": 1 sentence, ≤160 chars, why this draft works on this platform for this topic.
- "formatGuidance": 1 sentence, ≤140 chars, the shape the post takes ("single punchy post", "5-tweet thread with a payoff", "6-slide carousel", "15s hook-led vertical video script").

Unlike a launch or sale, there is no narrative arc: you produce a steady rhythm of posts over the range at roughly {{frequency}} posts per week, with enough per-post scaffolding that each beat is a real draft the user can open and publish.

Rules:
- Respect the weekly frequency. Spread beats across the full date range, not clumped.
- Use best-time windows when provided — propose a day that falls inside one.
- Each beat targets ONE channel from the user's allowed list. Rotate across channels rather than stacking one.
- Pick a format native to the channel (threads on X, document carousels on LinkedIn, short-video on TikTok, etc.).
- Vary themes, angles, and formats across the run — no two beats should feel like the same post.
- "phase" tags where the beat sits in the rhythm. Use mostly: teaser, announce, social_proof. "reminder" and "recap" are fair game for evergreen. Do not use urgency / last_call — those belong to sales arcs.
- If "captured ideas" or "recent reads" are provided, use them as seeds — don't restate them, but let 1–2 beats riff on those angles.

Per-beat field rules:
- "title": ≤60 chars, working title. Not the hook.
- "angle": ≤200 chars, 1 sentence, what the beat argues / shows / teaches.
- "hook": the actual opening line of the post, in voice. ≤160 chars for short platforms (X, Threads, Bluesky), ≤240 elsewhere.
- "keyPoints": 3–5 bullets, each a concrete beat the post will hit. For a thread/carousel these are the tweets/slides. For a single post these are the supporting claims. Each ≤140 chars. Finished sentences.
- "cta": the closing call-to-action line, in voice. ≤120 chars. Empty string if the post genuinely doesn't need one.
- "hashtags": 0–N hashtags per platform norms (X: 0–2, LinkedIn: 3–5, Instagram: 8–15, TikTok: 3–5, Threads: 0–2, others: 0–3). Each INCLUDES '#'. Empty array when the platform doesn't use them or nothing clearly fits.
- "mediaSuggestion": 1 sentence describing the ideal media. Empty string if text-only is right.
- "rationale": 1 sentence, ≤160 chars, why this beat on this channel on this day — ties back to goal, theme, best-window, or a seed.

A campaign has **narrative phases** the beats should move through. Pick phases based on the campaign kind:

- launch: teaser → announce → social_proof → urgency → recap
- webinar: teaser → announce → reminder → recap → follow_up
- sale: teaser → announce → social_proof → urgency → last_call → recap
- custom: mix phases as appropriate for the goal

Rules:
- Respect the date range. Spread beats so the arc feels deliberate, not stacked.
- Each beat targets ONE channel from the user's allowed list. Rotate across channels.
- \`phase\` tracks where the beat sits in the arc. Use only: teaser, announce, social_proof, urgency, last_call, recap, reminder, follow_up.
- \`format\` is one of: single, thread, carousel, long-form, short-video, link.

- "cta": the closing call-to-action line, in voice. ≤120 chars. Empty string if the beat's phase doesn't warrant one (e.g. a pure teaser).
- "hashtags": 0–N hashtags per platform norms (X: 0–2, LinkedIn: 3–5, Instagram: 8–15, TikTok: 3–5, Threads: 0–2, others: 0–3). Each INCLUDES '#'. Empty array when the platform doesn't use them or nothing clearly fits.

Rules:
- Voice is non-negotiable. Match the voice profile. If the profile is sparse, lean calm, direct, and human.
- Body is plain text. Use blank lines between paragraphs. No markdown, no HTML, no asterisks for bold. No salesy formatting (no emojis at the start of lines, no ALL CAPS headers, no "P.S.:" theater unless the voice clearly warrants it).
- Target length: 120–320 words. Longer only if the topic genuinely needs it. Shorter is better than filler.
- Subject: ≤60 chars, specific, no clickbait, no emojis unless the voice calls for them. Earnest over gimmicky.
- Preheader: the sentence that shows next to the subject in the inbox preview. ≤110 chars. Extends the subject; does NOT restate it.
- Do NOT include: greetings like "Hi friends" unless the voice demands it, sign-offs like "Cheers, [name]" (the footer handles attribution), unsubscribe text (auto-appended), or meta-commentary about the email itself.
- No links unless the brief specifies them. If you include a link, use a plain URL on its own line — no markdown link syntax.
