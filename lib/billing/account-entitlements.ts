// Unified entitlement resolver. Aggregates every subscription row across
// every workspace a user owns and projects it down to:
//   - account-level quotas (workspace count)
//   - per-workspace quotas (channel count, member count)
//
// This is the single source of truth the gating layer reads from. UI
// affordances, server-action guards, and downgrade soft-caps all go
// through here instead of poking the subscriptions table directly.
//
// Model:
//   - Base plan ("basic" / "bundle") lives on a specific workspace and
//     provides channel seats for that workspace.
//   - "workspace_addon" seats grant the right to own additional
//     workspaces. Each new workspace buys its own channels independently;
//     no channels or members are bundled with the workspace add-on.
//   - "member_addon" seats are per-workspace today (account-pooled in a
//     later phase); each seat adds one member slot to that workspace's
//     allowance.
