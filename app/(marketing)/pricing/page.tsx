// ─── FAQ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const FAQ = [
	{
		q: "What's Muse?",
		a: "Muse is the AI layer that sits on top of Basic. It's trained on your writing — past posts, docs, tone sliders — so every generation sounds like you, per channel. It also covers advanced campaigns (beat sheets), fan-out (one long post → threads, carousels, scripts), best-time + virality scoring, performance commentary, and inbox replies in your style. Basic has a simpler AI companion; Muse is the full creative partner.",
	},
	{
		q: "Why are Basic and Muse priced the same per channel?",
		a: "Because they scale the same way. Each connected channel costs us real money to read, schedule, and publish to, and each Muse-enabled channel costs us another slice of model time. Same shape, same band discounts — add them up for your bill. Simpler to reason about than two different curves.",
	},
	{
		q: "How does the discount work past 10 channels?",
		a: "Same-price flat for the first 10 channels, then −$0.50 per channel every 5 channels through 25, then flat from there. So channels 1–10 are $5 (basic) or $10 (with Muse); 11–15 drop to $4.50/$9; 16–20 to $4/$8; 21–25 to $3.50/$7; and from the 26th onward it's $3/$6 forever.",
	},
	{
		q: "What's in the AI companion that Free and Basic users get?",
		a: "Single-shot, generic: write a post from a prompt, refine this text, shorten/expand/translate, suggest a hook or caption. It's not trained on your past work — think of it as a smart draft button. Free users get 50 generations a month, Basic users get fair-use unlimited. If you want the AI to sound like you, that's Muse.",
	},
	{
		q: "Can I turn Muse on for some channels and not others?",
		a: "Yes. Muse is a per-channel switch. A 5-channel user might run Muse on their 3 most important channels and leave the other 2 on Basic. Billing updates at the next cycle; credits pool across the Muse-enabled channels.",
	},
	{
		q: "What about generation limits on Muse?",
		a: "Each Muse channel includes enough generation for normal use. If you run a heavy campaign, we auto-top-up at $10 per 1,000 credits and cap total overage at 2× your monthly bill. You'll see warnings at 80% and 100% of the pool — never a surprise invoice.",
	},
	{
		q: "What's the free tier actually good for?",
		a: "Three connected channels, manual posting, scheduling, the calendar, link-in-bio, and the AI companion with 50 generations a month. Stay here as long as you like — Free never expires, no card at signup.",
	},
	{
		q: "What about video?",
		a: "Reels, TikTok, and Shorts generation is priced separately at $1/second because video costs 10–100× more to generate than text. Available as a Muse add-on: packs of 45 seconds ($30) or 150 seconds ($90).",
	},
	{
		q: "Nonprofit / student / OSS discounts?",
		a: "Yes — 40% off Basic and Muse for registered nonprofits, full-time students, and maintainers of OSS projects with 1,000+ stars. Email sales@usealoha.app with proof.",
	},
	{
		q: "Is there a team or multi-brand plan?",
		a: "Multi-brand today is the 'extra style profile' add-on ($5/mo each). Teams/workspaces are a separate initiative we'll ship after the AI-native core lands — we won't rush a multi-tenant model that doesn't hold up.",
