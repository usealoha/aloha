            The category is loud. Every tool in it is designed to make you
            post more. We think that's the wrong problem. The right problem
            is helping you notice when you've said the thing — and stop.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aloha is a social media tool. We help creators and small teams
            schedule posts across eight networks, triage comments and DMs
            in one place, and automate the quiet choreography that used
            to be manual — a welcome DM to a new follower, a reminder post
            the day after a launch, a carousel cross-posted as a Threads
            reply chain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nothing in that sentence is novel. What is, we think, is the
            set of choices we've made about <em>how</em> to do it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            1. The category is upside-down.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Most social tools measure their success by how much you use
            them. Time in app. Posts per week. Notifications delivered.
            These are the same metrics the platforms themselves optimise
            for. Your scheduler inherits the incentive structure of the
            thing you're using it to escape.
          </p>

          <p>
            We turned that around early. We measure our success by how
            much of your week you get <em>back</em>. A creator who used to
            spend nine hours a week on social and now spends three is a
            win, even if they post less. Our onboarding asks you to
            estimate the hours you want to save. Our quarterly review
            checks whether we did.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            2. Voice is the point.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Most AI writing tools in this category ship with a bank of
            templates. "Five lessons I learned from a plumber." "Here's
            a hot take that will get engagement." They're fast, and they
            make every creator sound interchangeable. We built a voice
            model that trains on your best posts — not your whole
            archive, the twelve that sounded most like you — so the
            rewrites it gives back have your cadence, your hook habits,
            your line breaks.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's slower to start. The first weekend is training. But the
            outputs feel like a careful ghostwriter, not a karaoke
            machine. Your editor can't always tell which drafts you
            wrote and which Aloha did. That's the bar we wanted.
          </p>

          <figure className="my-12 pl-6 lg:pl-8 border-l-2 border-peach-300">
            <blockquote className="font-display italic text-[22px] lg:text-[26px] leading-[1.3] tracking-[-0.005em] text-ink">

            3. Automation with a thumb in the loop.
          </h2>

          <p>
            The Matrix — our automation canvas — ships with human
            approvals as the <em>default</em>. Every outbound DM, reply
            and comment the automations generate pauses for you to
            confirm. You can turn approvals off per-matrix when you know
            what you're doing, but you have to choose that actively. We
            designed the defaults so you can't accidentally become one of
            those brands that spams its own audience with templated
            <em> "Hey {"{firstName}"}, I noticed you're interested in…"</em>{" "}
            messages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Automation is powerful. It's also how brands lose trust. We
            picked defaults that make that harder.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            4. The notification budget is zero.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Aloha sends one email a day and zero push notifications by
            default. The app cannot light up your phone unless you
            explicitly ask it to. The opt-in is buried under a
            confirmation dialog that reads "are you sure? we'd rather
            you not."
          </p>

          <p>
            We made this choice because every other social tool's
            notification strategy is a function of <em>its</em> growth,
            not yours. The more pings we send, the more "engaged" you
            look on our churn dashboard — and the more distracted you are
            in real life. So we don't. If you miss something urgent, our
            daily digest will surface it. If you truly want push, turn it
            on, and we'll respect that choice.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            5. The export button is the point.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Every piece of data Aloha holds is exportable, without
            friction, in the format your next tool wants. CSV or JSON
            for posts. ICS for the calendar. Markdown digest for your
            team's Notion. Your subscribers as whatever standard your
            email provider imports. No "email us for a backup". No
            "enterprise-only data access". No <em>charge-you-for-leaving</em>{" "}
            migration fees.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our importers go the other way with the same respect —{" "}
            <Link href={routes.compare.migrationGuide}>every major
            competitor has a one-click migration path into us</Link>. The
            offramp and the onramp are the same size. That's how we build
            trust: the tool should earn the stay every month, not trap
            you when the stay is over.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            6. We'll tell you to go elsewhere.
          </h2>

          <p>
            There are kinds of work Aloha isn't the best answer for.
            Enterprise social-listening at scale — go to Hootsuite.
            Customer-care orgs with 10,000 DMs a week — go to Sprout.
            Pure-X thread writers who never expect to post elsewhere —
            Typefully's editor is better. We wrote{" "}
            <Link href={routes.compare.migrationGuide}>honest
            comparison pages</Link> that say so plainly. If we aren't
            the right tool, our job is to point you at the right one,
            not to trick you into staying through friction.
          </p>

          <p>
            This sounds obvious. In practice, it means writing a
            comparison page that starts with "here's where the
            competitor is stronger" before "here's where we are." We
            keep it in our content style guide as a hard rule.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            7. Growth at the right speed.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our seed investors signed a side letter that says, in
            writing: Aloha is a calm tool, not a growth engine. Revenue
            per creator, not creators per quarter. Profitability before
            velocity. We read it out loud at the last board meeting and
            got uncomfortable laughter, but we meant it.
          </p>

          <p>
            This doesn't mean we won't grow. It means we won't do the
            things that most "growth" playbooks want us to do — push
            notifications on day two, daily email drips, referral
            programmes that pay creators to tag their audience. We'd
            rather have forty thousand customers who love the tool than
            four million who are passively using it.
          </p>

          <figure className="my-14 p-10 rounded-3xl bg-primary-soft border border-primary/15">

              Not a louder tool. Not a bigger feature list. A tool that
              helps you notice when you're done — and close the tab.

            8. Who this is for.
          </h2>

          <p>
            Solopreneurs who don't have time to become a social media
            agency on the side. Creators whose voice is the product.
            Small teams that don't need fifty SKUs. Agencies that want
            their clients to feel cared for, not processed. Nonprofits
            with missions that deserve better tooling than they can
            usually afford. We wrote{" "}
            <Link href={routes.for.solopreneurs}>dedicated pages</Link>{" "}
            for each — they're more useful than a generic "who it's for".
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're a marketing ops leader at a Fortune 100 company
            running a hundred-seat deployment, we probably aren't for
            you. And that's fine. Go build something calm of your own.

            9. How this holds up.
          </h2>

          <p>
            A manifesto is worth nothing if the product doesn't keep it.
            We built three commitments into how we run:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-6 space-y-4">
            <li>
              Every quarterly plan includes a &ldquo;what we didn't
              ship to preserve the calm&rdquo; note. Things that would
              have added growth but cost more than they paid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every hire signs a short values document before day one.
              It includes &ldquo;we will tell customers to use a
              competitor when it's right&rdquo; as a bullet.
            </li>
            <li>
              This manifesto has a{" "}
              <Link href={routes.product.whatsNew}>revision history</Link>.
              When we change a belief, we show you the diff.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="font-display text-[28px] lg:text-[36px] font-normal leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.015em] text-ink mt-16 mb-5 scroll-mt-20">
            10. Try the tool.
          </h2>

          <p>
            You've read a lot of our words. If the beliefs above map to
            your own, the product is the rest of the argument. The free
            plan is free forever, without a card. Three channels, ten
            posts per channel per month. It won't run out, and we won't
            email you to upgrade.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best manifesto is the product behaving the way it said
            it would. Ours is below.
